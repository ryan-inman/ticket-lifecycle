<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<p>
Before helping any End-Users they first submit their ticket to the help desk as below (http://localhost/osTicket/).
</p>
<br />

<p>
After submitting they will receive a notifcation confirming that their ticket has been received.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<b>Step 1: Intake</b>
</p>
<br />

<p>
The Help Desk Agent/Admin logs in and sees the available tickets. They can view unassigned tickets along with their priorities. The ticket details include Ticket #, Last Updated, Subject, From (user who created the ticket), priority, and Assigned To (can be assigned to a specific person or team).
</p>
<br />

<p>
<b>Step 2: Assignment and Communication</b>
</p>
<br />

<p>
The Help Desk Agent/Admin can assign the ticket to themselves, a specific person, or a team. The ticket can also be reassigned to different departments or individuals. Communication regarding the ticket is done through notes and updates.
</p>
<br />

<p>
Due to the ticket's complexity and severity, it will be assigned to Agent 1 within the Systems Administrator department.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<b>Step 3: Working the Issue</b>
</p>
<br />

<p>
Login to osTicket as Agent 1 and navigate to the assigned ticket.
</p>
<br />

<p>
As Agent 1, we will begin addressing the ticket. Start by modifying the Priority Level for this ticket from Normal to Emergency due to its significant impact on the business. Additionally, adjust the SLA Plan to SEV-A to align with the updated Priority Level. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
Note that the Ticket Thread will now reflect the updates we have made.
<br />

<p>
<b>Step 4: Resolution</b>
</p>
<br />
  
<p>
If needed, the ticket can be escalated to a higher level of support. Collaboration with other teams or departments may be required. Once the issue is resolved, the ticket is marked as closed and moved to the "closed" tickets column.
</p>
<br />

<p>
To bring mobile banking back online we will coordinate with the System Admin Team. Let's post a reply to update the customer.
</p>
<br />

<p>
After reaching out to the System Admin Team we have resolved the issue and can now close the ticket by selecting "Closed" in the Ticket Status box.
</p>
<br />
  
<p>
The ticket has now been moved to the closed ticket column, indicating a successful resolution has been found!
